## [1.0.4] — 2026-07-02
### Fixed
- Replaced `lsof`/`ss`-based process detection with direct `/proc/net/tcp` kernel reads for reliable service lifecycle management
- Added intentional stop flag (`.service_stopped`) to prevent the Process Manager and service reachability engine from auto-restarting services that were intentionally stopped via the API
- Increased service start detection poll window for more reliable startup confirmation

## [1.0.3] — 2026-07-01
### Fixed
- Fixed empty `Tools available` section in agent system prompts that prevented subordinate agents from accessing tools like `search_engine` and `document_query`
- Project services now spawn as `aexyr-user` by default, allowing the agent to manage (stop/restart) its own deployed services without permission errors
